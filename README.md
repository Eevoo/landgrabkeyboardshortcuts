# Land Grab: Keyboard Shortcuts
A list of all of my currently collected knowledge about global and application-centric keyboard shortcuts.

## Why?
When I'm developing my dreamed-up, pie-in-the-sky hobbyist applications like a keyboard-controlled MouseGrid or ShowNumbers and I'm overengineering before I even have a single line of code, I like to procrastinate starting to code by taking a long time to pick the keyboard shortcut I should use. This README is one such procrastination method, to help me answer questions like:

1. Can I use this keyboard shortcut without messing with another application?
2. Is there a global keyboard shortcut I can use across Windows, Mac, and Linux that won't interfere with existing system shortcuts or applications?
3. Could I ever possibly write down a list of most major OS and application shortcuts into a single document without spending all of my life looking up user manuals each time?

What's the answer to each above? I don't know yet. But we're procrastinating figuring out how to draw a mouse grid on Wayland right now, so let the text continue!

### Linux
Yes there are shells out the wazoo, and desktop environments, and X vs Wayland, and many more things. Linux fragmentation strikes again. I use Fedora KDE so that's what I'm filling out myself. The GNOME folks can add theirs if they like / I will add GNOME stuff because I want to be a completionist on some date in the future.
